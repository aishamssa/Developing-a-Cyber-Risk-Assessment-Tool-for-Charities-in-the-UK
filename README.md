# Developing-a-Cyber-Risk-Assessment-Tool-for-Charities-in-the-UK
Goal: To design and evaluate a evidence-based risk assessment tool that helps UK charities identify and prioritise cybersecurity risks using adapted principles of NIST and ISO.
•	Aims - a desired outcome or purpose to be achieved, a statement of intent
1.	My first aim is to design and develop a lightweight, Python-based cyber risk assessment tool that helps UK charities identify and evaluate their exposure to phishing and donor-data risks.
2.	My second aim to improve my technical and analytical understanding of risk assessment methodologies by implementing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST SP 800-30 scoring logic.
•	Objective – a specific, tangible proven achievement 
1.	Conduct comparative research on cybersecurity frameworks (NIST CSF, ISO 27005, CIS Controls, NCSC guidance) and development environments (Python vs Java, Streamlit vs Flask) to identify the most practical and ethical approach for UK charities
2.	Design a non-technical risk-assessment questionnaire structured around NIST CSF domains (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
3.	Implement the questionnaire and NIST SP 800-30 risk-scoring logic using Python and Streamlit.
4.	Test my risk assessment tool using synthetic charity profiles to assess reliability, usability, and logical consistency.
5.	Document and evaluate findings, framework comparisons, and recommendations for possible future advancements
•	Target - an indicator which establishes how successfully you achieved an aim or objective.
1.	Delivery of a framework and tool comparison table
2.	Completion of a 30-question NIST-CSF-based questionnaire
3.	A functional Streamlit UI generating automated risk scores
4.	Validation against at least five synthetic test profiles
5.	A documented evaluation with recommendations for future work.

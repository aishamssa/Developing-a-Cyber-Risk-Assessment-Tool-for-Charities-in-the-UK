# Questionnaire Import and Validation
# This module is responsible for loading the questionnaire data from a CSV file using Pandas. 
# Since your tool is data-driven, this file enables you to modify or expand the questionnaire without changing your codebase. 
# The script will include functions that (1) read the questionnaire, (2) validate required columns, and (3) prepare the data in a structured format for downstream processing. 
# In the context of your project, the data loader plays a crucial role in ensuring that the scoring engine works consistently regardless of the questionnaire format allowing your tool to remain flexible and scalable.

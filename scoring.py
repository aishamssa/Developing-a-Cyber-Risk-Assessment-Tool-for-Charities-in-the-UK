# NIST-Aligned Risk Calculation Engine
# This script contains the core mathematical and logical functions of your tool. It operationalises the NIST SP 800-30 risk model by computing likelihood, impact, and an overall risk score. 
# The scoring engine will eventually integrate domain weights, question importance, and customised recommendations. 
# Early in the project, this script will simply apply basic formulas to demonstrate system functionality. 
# As the implementation matures, the scoring logic will be refined and documented. 
# This module represents the analytical heart of the project and demonstrates your ability to translate theoretical cybersecurity frameworks into a functioning computational system.
